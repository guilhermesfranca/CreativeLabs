# Landing Page - Design Agency

This project is a landing page for a design agency, built with **ReactJS**. The main goal was to consolidate the knowledge gained, such as using `useState` and `onClick`, as well as creating a componentized structure to improve code organization and reusability.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState**: React hook used to manage the pageâ€™s state.
- **onClick**: Event used to capture clicks and perform actions, like switching the page theme.
- **CSS Modules**: Isolated styling per component to avoid style conflicts.
- **Next.js**: React framework optimized for production and static page generation.

## Features

- **Theme Toggle**: The page includes a theme toggle functionality that switches between light and dark modes, using `useState` to control the theme state. The button icon also changes depending on the active theme.
- **Componentization**: The code is modularized into different components (`Topo`, `SecaoBanner`, `Rodape`, `SecaoExperienciaTrabalho`, `Card`) to improve structure and code reusability.
- **Responsiveness**: The page is responsive, ensuring a good viewing experience across different screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- **/components**: Contains all reusable components (such as `Topo`, `SecaoBanner`, etc.).
- **/public**: Stores static images like the logo and banner.
- **/styles**: CSS styles separated by component using CSS Modules.
